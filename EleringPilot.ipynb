    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Major technological improvements in renewable energy technology and reduced construction costs over the past few years have led to a rapid development of solar and wind generation all across the globe. Unlike the big coal and gas generators, renewables were much faster and cheaper to build, sparking the rise of many privately owned generators joining the energy market and forming the foundation for a new distributed energy system -  a system where energy buyers would not need to rely on one single source of electricity but could potentially pick and choose the producers that would fit their needs the best and transact with them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first sign of this new emerging disintermediated system has been the rise of corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Popularised by blue-chip companies in the United States, these arrangements were structured around a transaction whereby a large corporation would commit to buy electricity directly from a new generator over a long period of time (typically 10+ years) for a fixed price. This helped generators to gain financial certainty and businesses to lock in low electricity prices offered by new renewable technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blockchain as a distributed and immutable ledger seemed like the perfect fit for this new emerging distributed system which is why WePower has designed a platform using blockchain to enable direct transactions between electricity users and producers. We have, however, taken into consideration the scalability limitations of most blockchains - ensuring these factors will not compromise the quality of our technological solutions nor the scale of our business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions in electricity markets are settled in hourly, 30 minutes or, in some markets soon, on a 5 min basis. This means that to process transactions between a single consumer and producer would create at least 8,760 data entries for a year and if you take a 10-year tenure of a standard PPA this would grow to 87,600 data entries at the point when the contracts are issued. In order for this system to reach meaningful scale, it needs to support thousands of buyers and hundreds of generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a scalable and cost-efficient technology stack we have set up an R&D team with the main focus on testing and optimizing our technology on different blockchain platforms. This paper describes our first test on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokenization process involves converting a realworld asset, in our case energy, into a digital token that can be stored, monitored and traded on a blockchain. The test used Estonia’s nationwide electricity consumption and production data obtained from [Estfeed](https://medium.com/wepower/wepower-in-partnership-with-elering-is-launching-a-pilot-project-to-tokenize-estonian-energy-7bb929eeed5c \"WePower in partnership with Elering is launching a pilot project to tokenize Estonian energy nationwide\"), the central electricity data repository in Estonia managed by our co-development partner [Elering](https://www.elering.ee/en \"Elering web page\").\n",
    "\n",
    "This test has been conducted using both Ethereum main and test networks. It was carried out across from modelling to live processing. It covered 67,017,042 data points. The following parts cover the technological context, hypothesis, test and implications of this first of a kind blockchain experiment."

    "### Scope\n",
    "WePower has several layers in its technology stack that have to work in sync with our business mission and development roadmap. With classical, fully centralized solutions the estimations regarding system operational costs and performance can be easily aligned with expectations or at least use known practices to assess these. For hybrid solutions that integrate a centralized platform with a decentralized public blockchain, operational cost and performance reference data is not readily available, therefore further analysis needs to be conducted. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of the tokenization test,  the WePower solution can be described in the following layers:\n",
    "* WePower cloud platform\n",
    "* Asynchronous Integration Layer (AIL)\n",
    "* Ethereum Main network\n",
    "\n",
    "![elering_solution_diagram](images/elering_solution_diagram.png \"Pilot Solution Diagram\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizations for both performance and cost can be achieved at each of these layers. The platform will be sending and receiving data to/from AIL. From there, it is the task of AIL to interface and communicate with Ethereum Mainnet, providing flexibility in the future to consider alternative blockchain solutions or multi-chain architectures. This is where the blockchain/DLT related system operational costs could be optimized, such as the amount of gas used for data storage. There will be two-way communications in the fully implemented end-to-end solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first phase of the tokenization test, the writing of the energy consumption and production data to the Ethereum blockchain was tested. This is the data set that WePower will utilize in its business activities and where a feasibility estimate is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyzed in detail what to write on the chain - as well as considered the cost and time regarding the blockchain activities. This resulted in two layers of activities for optimization purposes, where we optimized the data off-chain and wrote the results to the chain. In the following chapters, we will focus on the write operations and the resulting findings."

    "The Elering pilot conceptually started in September 2017, when the [Memorandum of Understanding was signed](https://medium.com/wepower/estonian-transmission-systems-operator-signing-with-wepower-bf5c791441f4 \"Memorandum of Understanding\") formalizing the initiative to pilot the uploading of national scale energy data into a public blockchain. By January 2018 it was clear that the scope should be the tokenization of electricity consumption and production data. To reach that goal, Smart Energy Contracts were written, detailed concepts and test plans were composed, data prepared and necessary integrations finalized. In October 2018 the test itself was finally concluded. All information about the process is presented below."

    "## Conceptual approach for the test\n",
    "A Smart Energy Contract (SEC) is a technical term that refers to the entity that defines and facilitates the Smart Energy Token implementation process. A Smart Energy Token is the part of a SEC that represents the ownership of rights and obligations of the energy token holder under a particular power purchase agreement. A wallet is an entity that aggregates ownership of Smart Energy Tokens in one or many SECs.\n",
    "- SECs contain energy tokens\n",
    "- Each token refers to a specific electricity consumers’ wallet\n",
    "- Wallets contain references to SECs\n",
    "- The platform has a capability to issue commands to SECs based on a business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERC20 and ERC721 token standards have their limitations for enabling the specific transactions needed by WePower. The reasoning for deviating from the well known token standards will be elaborated further in future analysis documents where we dig deeper into the wallet structures, contract versioning, and log chaining along with Smart Energy Tokens and Smart Energy Contracts. We are going to use this concept for tokenizing virtual power purchase agreements, which will become smart derivative contracts.\n",

The GDPR applies to “personal data”, meaning any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier. The goal of the first stage of the pilot was to generate Smart Energy Tokens to represent energy ownership and match consumption with production. The data used was an entire set of Estonian electricity production and consumption data received from Estonian Transmission System Operator Elering for the year 2017."

    "### Creating smart contracts\n",
    "In detailed concept preparation, we had a number of assumptions that had to be addressed. Storing the data on blockchain for transparently representing source and ownership was a necessity. To simulate different energy sources we had to generate three different Smart Energy Contracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first one was a contract with all the consumption and production information. The second one was for fixing the amount of green energy used by consumers. This is recognized in the context of the current test as a “green energy token”. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third one was for fixing how much was consumed from dirty sources. For simplicity and due to lack of easily accessible granular data, this was decided to be recognized as an “unknown energy token”. “Unknown” because it is not monitored on an hourly basis in a publicly available format of how much and what source of energy is used."

    "## Analysing the dataset\n",
    "Our analysis is based on real-world electricity production and consumption data. We worked with both renewable and non-renewable energy production data. In order to retrieve the data from Elering, we utilized Elering’s Estfeed data exchange platform. The Estfeed platform facilitates secure and authorized access to energy (e.g. electricity and gas) meter consumption data by enabling end consumers, scattered producers and network operators to choose who to share their data with via the online platform e-Elering. In addition, public energy data can also be received, e.g. electricity prices or weather information through the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data provided by Elering was anonymized by aggregating together the hourly consumption data from all meter points within each postcode. Essentially, the data of all neighbors was added together, so that no single neighbor could be identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "While aggregated data can be obtained for the whole country for a service fee, personal, meter-point level data, can only be obtained for those houses and enterprises, whose owners have agreed to share data with you. This feature, however, was not used in the current test."

    "#### Analyzing data points\n",
    "The initial plan was to create the dataset based on one year’s electricity consumption of 700,000 households in Estonia. This would have meant roughly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$700,000 \\text{ households} \\times 365 \\text{ days} \\times 24 \\text{ readings a day} = 6,132,000,000 \\text{ data points}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the time needed for the test period, we had to consider that the average block time on the Ethereum Main network is 15 seconds. That was the absolute best-case scenario and we additionally assumed we could store 200 data points per block to the contract. In the real world, other people would be able to utilize the blocks or WePower would have to pay the higher gas price to get the full capacity of each block.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{ \\text{Count of data points}}{ \\text{Data points per block}} \\times \\text{Seconds per block}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the full set of granularly separated data points, it would have meant that simply storing the data would have taken: $\\frac{6,132,000,000 \\text{ data points}}{200 \\text{ data points per block}} \\times 15 \\text{ seconds} \\approx 5,300 \\text{ days}$ which is roughly 14 years."

Considering the gas consumption per transaction, that would have required $30,700,000 \\times 21,000 = 644,700,000,000$ gas, estimating to 5,472,810,000,000 Gwei at 8.5 Gwei gas price level, which can be calculated at any time with the current prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "For storing of those data points $6,132,000,000 \\times 20 000 \\approx 122,640,000,000,000$ gas was needed, estimating to 1,042,440,000,000,000 Gwei at 8.5 Gwei price level.  At the time of our calculations, this would have amounted to a cost of $1,042,440 \\text{ ETH} + 5,472 \\text{ ETH}$, which was at the time of calculations respectively $\\text{EUR } 208.5 \\text{ million } + \\text{ EUR } 1.1 \\text{ million } = \\text{ EUR } 209.6 \\text{ million}$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For loading the consumption and production data into the ETH Main network we chose to aggregate the data on a zip code level instead of a granular consumption point level and summarize hourly consumption into monthly consumption. This led us to the volume of $3,837 \\times 12 = 46,044$ data points. The decision to aggregate the consumption data was also supported by concerns for personal data confidentiality from the GDPR perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the cost was not the issue when loading the contracts into ETH test network, the data set was prepared on the zip code and hourly consumption and production level, which meant the data set of $3,837 \\times 8,727 = 33,485,499$ where 8,727 is less than $24 \\times 365$ due to removed data anomalies. The main constraint for going more granular was the time needed for loading the contracts into the ETH test network.\n",

This led to removing one day’s consumption data because there was missing data for some hours, which would affect statistics aggregated on a daily level.

The data we used (consumption and production data with added information) however needed a lot less precision. As described in the section above, for a large scale dataset we had a high amount of data points, but inserting our data into a 256-bit number in Solidity, we were able to accommodate several units of energy data into 1 number and that resulted in less separate data points for the ETH blockchain. In our case, we were able to fit 15 units of data into 256 bits. Therefore we were also able to upload the same data with 15 times less gas cost, 15 times fewer transactions and time."

You can see this in Figure 3, where at 4.1 Gwei took remarkably more time on average for a transaction to go through. Also in Figures 6 and 7 it can be seen that on 12.10.2018 the hours between 7 and 19 are missing for the same reason - no transactions were carried out while the next in line transaction of the batch was waiting.\n",

For the 3rd until the 10th hour of the test (21 till 07) the uploading logic of batches per 15 was used, this caused a situation where waiting time before our transactions were included in blocks was very high.

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "Ethereum is mature enough to accommodate contracts with multi-year terms. There are promising alternatives available as well in the development phase, but their infancy is a concern in relation to typical durations of energy contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum performance indicators are sufficient for WePower to operate the renewable energy procurement and trading platform at this stage. The hybrid platform architecture can be operated with the required cost-performance for the current business needs. In order to meet increasing performance requirements in the future though, WePower will have to consider validating other blockchain/DLT solutions to identify more efficient systems to run the larger scale trading platform."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The first phase of the Elering tokenization pilot helped WePower to validate and verify the logic and processes that will be at the core of the WePower platform. We have been able to generate Smart Energy Contracts and Smart Energy Tokens based on real-life data on various granularity levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "During this process of data preparation, we gained valuable experience in dealing with an Energy System Operator. It is possible to exchange data in various formats, but the existence of the Estfeed data hub that provides data in a unified format makes it possible to operate the WePower energy contracting and trading model more efficiently and will be the focal point of further innovation when more data hubs are implemented across markets in various countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "We acknowledge that the scalability of Ethereum blockchain currently has limitations. However, the problem is being tackled by Ethereum developers with plans to implement sharding, i.e. partitioning data into subsets, and moving from energy-intensive Proof of Work to a more environmentally friendly Proof of Stake consensus model. Ethereum co-founder [Vitalik Buterin has stressed](https://www.coindesk.com/modest-proposal-vitalik-unveils-multi-year-vision-ethereum/ \"Vitalik Unveils Multi-Year Vision for Ethereum\") that there is a need for solutions that mitigate expensive storage costs that could escalate exponentially as the system expands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance between cost and transaction confirmation times has to be considered continuously while communicating with the blockchain. Practical lessons from coding perspective will be analyzed and implemented in the coming stages of WePower’s pipeline. While Ethereum is currently one of the most mature blockchain solutions, supporting smart contracts, a fully decentralized application for large-scale autonomous usage is not yet feasible for large-scale energy trading on the blockchain. For now, a hybrid solution will be utilized while monitoring the rapid development of Ethereum as well as other blockchain/DLT technologies."

The roadmap is leading the way to concepts that support WePower in growing to a fully functioning virtual utility. For that WePower has defined a series of features and use cases that need to be covered at a detailed level. For supporting WePower’s primary value offer - contract versioning, wallet structures, log chaining and real electricity data and price settlement on blockchain have to be thoroughly analysed and tested."

This is also known as the second phase of the Elering pilot, where we will explore different aspects of secondary Smart Energy Contract marketplace dynamics. Meaning that we will go into more detail regarding various events that can happen with market participants and contracts during the Smart Energy Contract lifecycle (including peer-to-peer trading of contracts, change in consumption profiles, settlement and netting of energy production data with electricity prices etc). This serves as preparation for concerns that might come up in the various stages of WePower’s business processes from the blockchain view."

Given that we will have done many tests on Ethereum by that point, we will have a good baseline to compare it to other blockchains. This serves the purpose of WePower not wasting time and resources developing functions on the blockchain that are not feasible for the future. Settlement tests will happen on the best possible blockchain for WePower’s needs. During the settlement tests, we will examine the possibilities of dealing with the settlement functionalities on the blockchain.\n",
